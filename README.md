task 1: 
first open the emcommerce and foodpanda login one app with these credentials and you can login and then.. you dont have to login in the other project by login with other app. 


task 2: 

ecommerce app. 

many things are done in the postman. but for the time limit I didnt do everything in the frontend. 

challenges and learnings:

task 1 gave me a lot of learning. previously I have done login with google. so it was a great experience
